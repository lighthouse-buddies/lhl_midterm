Yes, you can add horizontal scrolling to a div to display multiple articles at a time. Here's an example of how you can achieve that using CSS:

HTML:
```html
<div class="story-container">
  <div class="story-scroll">
    <!-- Repeat this article block for each article -->
    <article class="story-preview">
      <!-- Article content goes here -->
    </article>
    <!-- Repeat this article block for each article -->
  </div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.story-container {
  width: 100%;
  overflow-x: auto;
}

.story-scroll {
  display: flex;
  width: fit-content;
}

.story-preview {
  flex: 0 0 33.33%; /* Display three articles at a time */
  padding: 10px;
  /* Other styling for the article goes here */
}
```

In this example, we have a container div with the class "story-container" that wraps the div with the class "story-scroll". The "story-container" div has a width of 100% to ensure it occupies the full width of its parent container. The `overflow-x: auto` property enables horizontal scrolling when the content overflows the container.

The "story-scroll" div uses `display: flex` to create a flex container that holds the article elements. The articles will be displayed side by side due to the flex display.

Each individual article with the class "story-preview" has a `flex: 0 0 33.33%` property, which makes each article take up one-third of the available width. This ensures that three articles are visible at a time in the horizontal scroll view.

You can repeat the article block for each article you want to display within the "story-scroll" div.

Feel free to adjust the styling and widths according to your specific requirements.
